# Welcome to GNU ARM Eclipse!

This site is dedicated to the **GNU ARM Eclipse** family of plug-ins and tools for embedded ARM development, based on GNU toolchains. This project is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse) and [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuarmeclipse/).

## The GNU ARM Eclipse plug-ins

These plug-ins provide Eclipse CDT (C/C++ Development Tooling) extensions for GNU ARM toolchains like **GNU Tools for ARM Embedded Processors**, **Linaro**, etc.

In short, the GNU ARM Eclipse plug-ins allow to create, build, debug and in general to **manage ARM and AArch64 projects** (executables and static/shared libraries, in both 32 and 64-bit versions) with the Eclipse framework (currently tested up to Eclipse 4.4 Luna). The plug-ins run on Windows, GNU/Linux and Mac OS X. For more details please visit the [Features]({{ site.baseurl }}/plugins/features/) page.

## Additional tools

Apart from the main Eclipse plug-ins, this project also includes several additional tools, distributed as separate packages.

* **GNU ARM Eclipse Windows Build Tools**

  The **GNU ARM Eclipse Windows Build Tools** subproject includes the additional tools required on Windows (**make** & **rm**).

* **GNU ARM Eclipse OpenOCD**

  The **GNU ARM Eclipse OpenOCD** subproject is a new distribution of [OpenOCD](http://openocd.org/), customised for a better/more convenient integration with the **GNU ARM OpenOCD Debugging** plug-in.

* **GNU ARM Eclipse QEMU**

  The **GNU ARM Eclipse QEMU** subproject is a fork of [QEMU](http://wiki.qemu.org/Main_Page) (an open source machine emulator), intended to provide support for Cortex-M emulation in GNU ARM Eclipse.

## Enjoy!

If you successfully installed and used this project, weâ€™d be honoured to receive your **[GitHub Stars](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/plug-ins/stargazers)**, and eventually a short review in the main [SourceForge Project](http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuarmeclipse) page.
