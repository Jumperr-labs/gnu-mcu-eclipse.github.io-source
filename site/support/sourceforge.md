## SourceForge tickets

## Bugs reports

If, while using the plug-in, you encounter any bugs, please let us know about it, using the [bug reports](http://sourceforge.net/p/gnuarmeclipse/bugs/) tracker.

## Features requests

As for any open source project, [feature requests](http://sourceforge.net/p/gnuarmeclipse/feature-requests/) will be more quickly processed if accompanied by patches.

## Support requests

For all other issues you have, that are not related to bugs or feature requests, you can use the [support requests](http://sourceforge.net/p/gnuarmeclipse/support-requests/) tracker. If you have further questions and these web sites (the blog and the wiki) do not provide the right answers for them, just let us know (in the [support requests](http://sourceforge.net/p/gnuarmeclipse/support-requests/) page) and we'll do our best to improve the web content.

## Blog comments

If you discover problems in the content of these pages (typos, wrong phrasing, etc), or you have suggestions on how to improve them, you can post comments to each individual page. Note: **do not** post comments to the blog pages containing support requests (the site is configured to moderate them automatically); instead use the [support requests](http://sourceforge.net/p/gnuarmeclipse/support-requests/) page.
