### The SourceForge way

All versions of the plug-in are available via the standard [SourceForge Files](http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuarmeclipse/files/gnuarmeclipse/) facility. Just navigate to the [Current Releases](http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuarmeclipse/files/Current%20Releases/) folder and select the 1.x folder. Then download the most recent archive, it should be a **zip** file with a long name like:
  ilg.gnuarmeclipse.repository-1.1.0-201310161930.zip


Please be aware that the Source Forge link to the **latest version may not be up-to-date**, and it is better to check the [Current Releases](http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuarmeclipse/files/Current%20Releases/) folder.

Also please note that not all plug-in versions run on all Eclipse versions, and usually new plug-in versions may require new Eclipse versions, so better try to stay as up-to-date with the Eclipse as possible. (For Eclipse Kepler 4.3 and later, use versions 1.x; for older Eclipses, try the final 0.5.5 version, but keep in mind it is no longer maintained).

### The Eclipse way

Once you start using this plug-in, further updates are available via the Eclipse standard install/update mechanism, using the following URL:

`http://gnuarmeclipse.sourceforge.net/updates`

If after selecting the update site the Eclipse does not present any plug-in, you have to disable the **Group items by category**, and the **GNU ARM C/C++ Development Support** is shown.

### Previews

For previews, experimental releases are posted to a separate update site:

`http://gnuarmeclipse.sourceforge.net/updates-test`

Sometimes you can use this site to test some features that are not completely implemented, or that might change before a final version is released.

This site is not always updated; use it carefully, back up your workspace, and do not use it for production projects.

### Rate and Review

If you successfully installed and used this plug-in, we'd be honoured to receive ratings (in the main [Project page](http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuarmeclipse)), and eventually a short review (in the main [Write a Review](http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuarmeclipse/reviews/new) page).
