## Why? What happened?

In Sep 2015, the old documentation sites were migrated from WordPress & MediaWiki to a new GitHub Pages static site, as part of the project migration from SourceForge to Github.

## What to do?

**Please search for the desired page in the table of contents available in the right pane.**

Then notify the site that brought you here to update the links.

If you cannot find the desired page, please let us know, using the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/gnuarmeclipse.github.io/issues/1) tracker, and we'll investigate. Be sure you copy the last part of the current URL, after the `?`, since this is the offending URL.
