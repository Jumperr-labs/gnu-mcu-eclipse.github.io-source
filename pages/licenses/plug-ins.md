## Copyright owner

The copyright owner for all the **GNU MCU Eclipse plug-ins** is Liviu Ionescu and all rights are reserved.

## Eclipse Public License

As the sole copyright owner, Liviu Ionescu released the GNU MCU Eclipse plug-ins for public use under the terms of the [Eclipse Public License v1.0](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html).

## Commercial Contributors

For a sustainable project development, Commercial Contributors are welcomed to share part of the development costs by means of commercial contracts (for maintenance, integration support or developing new features) and/or by sponsorships/donations (generally compensating for pre-exisiting work included in their derivative work).

## Dual license?

The opportunity of releasing future versions under dual license was considered, with the Eclipse Public License for all Recipients excluding subsequent Commercial Contributors, and a commercial license, where the license fee will no longer be waived; however no date was set yet for such a license change.

## Sponsorships & donations

To prevent changing the license terms, this project will depend both on commercial contracts and on [sponsorships & donations]({{ site.baseurl }}/finance/sponsorship/).
