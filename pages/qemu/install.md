## Overview

The **GNU ARM Eclipse QEMU** is a fork of the public open-source [QEMU](http://wiki.qemu.org/Main_Page) project, customised for more support of Cortex-M cores, and a better integration with the **GNU ARM QEMU Debugging** plug-in.

## Download

All **GNU ARM Eclipse QEMU** versions are available from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/qemu/releases) page.

## Install

The details of installing the **GNU ARM Eclipse QEMU** on various platforms are presented below, for each platform.

### Windows

For user convenience, the Windows versions of **GNU ARM Eclipse QEMU** are packed as Windows setup wizards. Go to the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/qemu/releases) page and download the latest version named like:

* `gnuarmeclipse-qemu-win32-2.2.92-201504041652-dev-setup.exe`
* `gnuarmeclipse-qemu-win64-2.2.92-201504041652-dev-setup.exe`

Select the `-win64-` file for 64-bits machines and the `-win32-` file for 32-bits machines.

Run the setup as usual.

It is recommended to keep the default install location:

![The QEMU Windows default install folder]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2015/windows-folder.png)

The default install location is:

* `C:\Program Files\GNU ARM Eclipse\QEMU\${version}`

The result is a structure like:

![QEMU Windows folders layout]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2015/windows-install-folders.png)

To check if QEMU starts, use the following command:

	C:\>"\Program Files\GNU ARM Eclipse\QEMU\2.2.92-201504041652-dev\bin\qemu-system-gnuarmeclipse.exe" --version
	GNU ARM Eclipse 32-bit QEMU emulator version 2.2.92

#### Drivers

For usual Cortex-M emulation, there are no special drivers required.

### OS X

For user convenience, the OS X version of GNU ARM Eclipse QEMU is packed as an OS X install package. Go to the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/qemu/releases) page and download the latest version named like:

* `gnuarmeclipse-qemu-osx-2.2.92-201504041609-dev.pkg`

As the name implies, this is an OS X package, that can be installed on any recent 64-bit OS X (the latest version was tested on 10.11).

Run the install as usual.

![The QEMU OS X Install page]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2015/mac-install.png)

The package is installed in:

* `/Applications/GNU ARM Eclipse/QEMU/${version}`

and the result is a folder structure similar to:

![The QEMU OS X install folders](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/qemu/wiki/assets/images/2015/mac-install-folders.png)

To check if QEMU starts, use:

	$ /Applications/GNU\ ARM\ Eclipse/QEMU/2.2.92-201504041609-dev/bin/qemu-system-gnuarmeclipse --version
	GNU ARM Eclipse 64-bit QEMU emulator version 2.2.92

### GNU/Linux

The GNU/Linux versions of GNU ARM Eclipse QEMU are packed as TGZ archives. Go to the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/qemu/releases) page and download the latest version named like:

* `gnuarmeclipse-qemu-debian64-2.2.92-201504041716-dev.tgz`
* `gnuarmeclipse-qemu-debian32-2.2.92-201504041746-dev.tgz`

As the name implies, these are Debian `tar.gz` archives, but can be executed on most recent GNU/Linux distributions (they were built on Debian 8 and were tested on Debian, Ubuntu, Manjaro, SuSE and Fedora). Select the `-debian64-` file for 64-bits machines and the `-debian32-` file for 32-bits machines.

Note: if your distribution already provides ready to run QEMU binaries, they currently cannot be used with the GNU ARM Eclipse plug-ins, because they lack the Cortex-M support; you need to install the **GNU ARM Eclipse QEMU**.

To install this package, unpack the distribution archive and copy it to `/opt/gnuarmeclipse/qemu/${version}`

```
sudo mkdir -p /opt/gnuarmeclipse
cd /opt/gnuarmeclipse
sudo tar xvf ~/Downloads/gnuarmeclipse-qemu-debian64-2.4.50-201510290935-dev.tgz
```

Note: although perfectly possible to install it in any location, it is recommended to use this location, since by default the plug-in searches for the executable in this location.

To check if QEMU starts and is recent, use:


	$ /opt/gnuarmeclipse/qemu/debian64-2.2.92-201504041716-dev/bin/qemu-system-gnuarmeclipse.exe" --version
	GNU ARM Eclipse 64-bit QEMU emulator version 2.2.92
	Copyright (c) 2003-2008 Fabrice Bellard

#### UDEV & Drivers

For usual Cortex-M emulation, there are no special UDEV definitions or drivers required.

## QEMU Debugging plug-ins

The QEMU debugging **plug-ins are not included** in these packages, and need to be installed as usual.
