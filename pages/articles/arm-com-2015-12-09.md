## Overview

The **[GNU ARM Eclipse project](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse)** includes a set of open source Eclipse plug-ins and tools to create/build/debug/manage **ARM** (32-bits) and **AArch64** (64-bits) applications and static/shared libraries, using the latest **GNU ARM GCC** toolchains. 

## Eclipse Marketplace

With the intent to further improve the user experience while installing/updating the GNU ARM Eclipse plug-ins, the project was registered to [Eclipse Marketplace](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/gnu-arm-eclipse):

## Benefits

The main advantage of using the Eclipse Marketplace is a simplified install procedure, no longer requiring to manually enter the update site address.

## The Install button

The Eclipse Marketplace not only provides a centralised index to locate projects, it goes one step further and provides a drag-and-drop browser button.

As seen above, the button can be included in any web page.

To use it, just drag-and-drop the button to a running Eclipse, and the plug-ins to install/update will be identified automatically:

If, for any reason, this does not work, it is always possible to search the Eclipse Marketplace manually:
