The Windows Build Tools binaries are published on GitHub  [Releases](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/windows-build-tools/releases)).

## Update the Change log

Scan the documentation Git log and add new entries to the [Change log]({{ site.baseurl }}/windows-build-tools/change-log/) (`pages/windows-build-tools/change-log.md`), grouped by days.

Close issues on the way. Refer to them as:

- **[Issue:\[#22\]\(...\)]**.

## Update the CHANGES.txt file

Edit the `gnuarmeclipse/info/CHANGES.txt` file (copy the entries from the web change log).

## Commit to the project git

In the **gnuarmeclipse/windows-build-tools** project, commit all changes.

## Check/clone/pull build scripts

Be sure the scripts in the **windows-build-tools.git** are up to date.

```console
$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/windows-build-tools.git \
  ~/Downloads/windows-build-tools.git
```

## Build

Important note: Before starting the build, double check if the repository is clean (all changes were committed), otherwise the build version will be stamped with `-dirty`.

```console
$ bash ~/Downloads/build-scripts.git/scripts/build-windows-build-tools.sh cleanall
$ caffeinate bash ~/Downloads/build-scripts.git/scripts/build-windows-build-tools.sh --all
```
