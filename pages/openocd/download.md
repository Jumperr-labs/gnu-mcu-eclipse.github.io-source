## Windows, GNU/Linux, OS X

All major platforms are supported. However releases might not include binaries for all platforms, so navigate to the most recent release which includes support for your platform and download the desired binaries.

## 64/32-bits

If running on a modern 64-bits system, it is highly recommended to download the 64-bits version, since running 32-bits applications on 64-bits systems sometimes fails due to some missing libraries.

For Windows the recommendation stands even stronger, to reduce the risk of 32-bits DLL rebases.

Note: For OS X only the 64-bits Intel binaries are available, and it is recommended to use a recent system.
