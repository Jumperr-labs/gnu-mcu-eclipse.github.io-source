The GNU MCU Eclipse ARM Embedded GCC build scripts provide a single tool to create multi-platform binaries, generating the Windows 32, Windows 64, GNU/Linux 32, GNU/Linux 64 and macOS distribution packages.

The script was developed on macOS, but it also runs on any recent GNU/Linux distribution.

## How to build?

For the final authoritative details, please refer to the separate [arm-none-eabi-gcc-build](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/arm-none-eabi-gcc-build/) project.
