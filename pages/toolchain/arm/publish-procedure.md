The ARM Embedded GCC binaries are published on GitHub [Releases](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/arm-none-eabi-gcc/releases/).

The procedure used to publish those binaries is documented on the [PUBLISH](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/arm-none-eabi-gcc/blob/master/PUBLISH.md) page in the same project.
