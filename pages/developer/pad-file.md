## Introduction

[PAD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Application_Description) is the Portable Application Description, and it helps authors provide product descriptions and specifications to online sources in a standard way, using a standard data format that will allow webmasters and program librarians to automate program listings.

The GNU ARM Eclipse Plug-ins PAD file is publically available in the [project Git](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/plug-ins/blob/develop/info/GNU_ARM_Eclipse_pad.xml).

## How to edit

Use the online [AppVisor](http://appvisor.com/)

Unfortunately it does not support long URLs and the GitHub Release URL cannot be entered.

The old solution was [PADBuilder.com](http://www.padbuilder.com/).

## How to publish

**AppVisor** can directly publish the file, after validation.
