## Plug-ins issues

In case you encounter problems while using the plug-ins, please consider the following:

* read the documentation pages
* check the [Known issues]({{ site.baseurl }}/support/known-issues/)
* check the [FAQ]({{ site.baseurl }}/support/faq/)
* scan the [SourceForge tickets]({{ site.baseurl }}/support/sourceforge/) for similar problems
* check the GitHub Issues

If you still could not find a solution, follow the recommendations in the GitHub Issues [tracker](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/plug-ins/issues/1) and add a new ticket.

![GNU ARM Eclipse Issues]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2015/github-gae-issues-welcome-new.png)

After you submit them, the issues will be labeled as:

* **bug** - use it for bug reports
* **enhancement** - use it for feature requests
* **help wanted**
* **question** - use them for support requests

### Bugs

If, while using the plug-in, you encounter any bugs, please let us know about them.

### Feature requests

As for any open source project, feature requests will be more quickly processed if accompanied by patches.

### Support requests

For all other issues you have, that are not related to bugs or feature requests, your issues will be labeled as 'help wanted' or 'question'.

## Tools issues

Similarly, each tool project has a separate GitHub Issue tracker.

* [QEMU Issues](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/qemu/issues/1/)
* [OpenOCD Issues](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/openocd/issues/1/)
* [Windows Build Tools Issues](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/windows-build-tools/issues/1/)

Please note that these trackers are mostly intended to the GNU ARM Eclipse specifics of these tools (like packing, or specific changes), and for issues affecting the core functionality, the user will most probably be asked to refer to the tools trackers.


## Web pages issues

If you discover problems in the content of these pages (typos, wrong phrasing, etc), or you have suggestions on how to improve them, you can use the [Web Issues](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/gnuarmeclipse.github.io/issues/1) tracker.

> Note: the migration from WordPress/MediaWiki to GitHub Pages involved quite significant changes to the web pages, including conversion to [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), which was done partly with scripts, partly manually; we are aware that it is very likely that lots of mistakes are still present in the pages; we would appreciate any help in fixing them.

## Use of private eMail

Please, please, please: **do not use private eMail for support**, since such messages will be replied with a link to this page. The reason for this rude behaviour is simply an attempt to efficiently use the time, since GitHub Issues are archived, and other people having similar problems might benefit from the answers.
