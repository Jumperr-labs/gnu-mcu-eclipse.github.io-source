Version v7.2.1-1.1 20180401 is a new release of **GNU MCU Eclipse ARM Embedded GCC**.

[Binary files Â»]({{ page.download_url }})

## Compliance

This release follows the official [GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm)  **7-2017-q4-major** release from December 18, 2017 and it is based on the `gcc-arm-none-eabi-7-2017-q4-major-src.tar.bz2` source invariant.

## Binaries

Binaries for **Windows**, **macOS** and **GNU/Linux** are provided.

The GNU/Linux binaries were built on two CentOS 6 Docker images (32/64-bits), and run on any distribution based on CentOS 6 or later.

The macOS binary was built on a macOS 10.10.5 and must run on any newer macOS system.

The Windows binaries were built with mingw-w64, and run on any reasonably recent **i686** and **x86_64** Windows machines.

Instructions on how to install the binaries are available in the [How to install the ARM toolchain?](https://gnu-mcu-eclipse.github.io/toolchain/arm/install/) page.

The toolchain is also available as an [xPack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gnu-mcu-eclipse/arm-none-eabi-gcc) and can be conveniently installed with [`xpm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xpm):

```console
$ xpm install @gnu-mcu-eclipse/arm-none-eabi-gcc --global
```

This installs the latest available version.

For better control and repeatability, the build scripts use Docker containers; all files required during builds are available as a separate [gnu-mcu-eclipse/arm-none-eabi-gcc-build](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/arm-none-eabi-gcc-build) project.
