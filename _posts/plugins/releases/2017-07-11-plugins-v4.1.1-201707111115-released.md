Version 4.1.1-201707111115 is a major release; thanks to a contribution from [SiFive](https://www.sifive.com), the project was enhanced with support for [RISC-V](https://riscv.org) devices and, to better reflect the multi-platform nature, was rebranded to **GNU MCU Eclipse**.

## New features

* a new build plug-in that allows to create and manage RISC-V projects was added
* explicit support for `--specs=nosys.specs'  added to both ARM and RISC-V plug-ins
* a new RISC-V only repository was added

## Addressed bugs

* [[Issue:#207](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/207)]: the regular expression used when processing dynamic variables had a flow; fixed;

## Template changes

* none

## Other changes

* the minimum requirements were raised to Eclipse 4.6 Neon.3, with Java 1.8; 
* with the addition of the RISC-V build plug-in, common ARM & RISC-V code was re-structured
* the preferences and properties pages to configure paths were moved from **C/C++ and Run/Debug under a common MCU page; separate pages for the ARM toolchain, RISC-V toolchain, Windows Build Tools, SEGGER J-Link, OpenOCD, pyOCD are available;
* the mechanism used to configure the debug plug-ins was migrated from Eclipse stringd to dynamic variables; macros like `${cross_prefix}` are all internal and are no longer present in the Run/Debug -> String Sbstitution preference page for inadvertent changes;
* the update sites were migrated from SourceForge to [Bintray](https://bintray.com/gnuarmeclipse/v4-neon-updates); the public URL for v4.x were migrated to (`http://gnu-mcu-eclipse.netlify.com/v4-neon-updates`) and will be automatically redirected to the new server; currently there are no more functional dependencies on SourceForge;
* the build scripts were updated to use SHA to compute the checksums for the generated binaries.

## Known problems

* the new plug-ins cannot be installed on older Eclipses; for this, use version 3.x, available from the same update site (`http://gnuarmeclipse.sourceforge.net/updates`);
* the new plug-ins have IDs prefixed with `ilg.gnumcueclipse.`, while the old IDs were prefixed with `ilg.gnuarmeclipse.`; being completely different, this allows to install the new plug-ins along the old one, but this should be avoided, and the old plug-ins should be uninstalled; preferably a new Eclipse instance should be used.
