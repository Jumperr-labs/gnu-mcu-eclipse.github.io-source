Version 4.2.1-201711101735 is a major release; thanks to a contribution from [SiFive](https://www.sifive.com), the project was enhanced with a template plug-in to create projects for the SiFive boards.

**Important**: the public URL for the new v4.x Eclipse update site is (`http://gnu-mcu-eclipse.netlify.com/v4-neon-updates/`).

## New features

* a new template plug-in was added to create projects for the SiFive boards 
* [Issue:[#249](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/249)] add GUI support to configure the TCL port (useful for multi-core debug sessions)
* gdbjtag.*: show Actual executable
* [Issue:[#247](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/247)] support for an explicitly embedded RISC-V toolchain (`riscv-none-embed-gcc`) was added
* [Issue:[#243](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/243)] when one of the remote servers did not respond, the packs plugin was waiting very long before timing out; shorter connect & read timeout were added
* [Issue:[#240](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/240)] - support for Linux & rtems toolchains was added
* for multi-core debug session, it is sometimes necessary to sart the OpenOCD server separately from the GDB client; to allow this a **Start GDB session** was added to OpenOCD GUI, to allow multiple GDB instances to attach to the same OpenCOD
* in the debug plug-ins, after the field used to configure the GDB executable, a new field showing the **Actual executable** was added

## Addressed bugs

* [Issue:[#242](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/242)] the debug plug-ins failed with an exception if some of the numeric fields were empty (the telnet/gdb port); fixed
* [Issue:[#246](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/246)] gdbjtag.*: substitute dynamic variables too;  add Actual client executable
* [Issue:[#222](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/222)] the `-fno-common` option was shown twice in the RISC-V build plug-in; fixed
* [Issue:[#224](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/224)] when the GDB server is started without starting the client, do not wait for the confirmation message, since it is expected that the user is responsible for the synchronisation. This allows to use `-l filename` to log debug messages, otherwise not possible since the echo message is written to the log, not the stderr stream.

## Template changes

* none

## Other changes

* none

## Known problems

* the new plug-ins cannot be installed on older Eclipses; for this, use the latest 3.x version, available from the deprecated update site (`http://gnuarmeclipse.sourceforge.net/updates`);
* the new plug-ins have IDs prefixed with `ilg.gnumcueclipse.`, while the old IDs were prefixed with `ilg.gnuarmeclipse.`; being completely different, this allows to install the new plug-ins alongside the old ones, but this should be avoided, and the old plug-ins should be manually uninstalled; preferably a new Eclipse instance should be used.
