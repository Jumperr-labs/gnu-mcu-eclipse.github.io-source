For those who want the latest OpenOCD features before the stable version is announced, the latest OpenOCD version built from the development repository was released in packages explicitly marked as `-dev`.

The OpenOCD developers claim that the development versions should be generally safe to use. In case you encounter problems, please revert to the latest 0.9.0 stable release.

The debug plug-in generally discovers the latest installed version, by using the Windows registry keys or by searching several designated folders. If you need to use a different version, update the `${openocd_path}` variable accordingly.
